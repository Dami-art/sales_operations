# sales_operations
Sales Operations Module - Product Sales Analysis in Python
This project was created as part of a training assignment at IT Academy.
It demonstrates basic sales data analysis in Python, including total sales calculation, identifying top‑ and low‑performing products, detecting critical inventory levels, and validating unusual or incorrect data entries.
The project consists of a simple analytics module (sales_operations.py) and an example script (main.py) that shows how the functions can be used in practice.
